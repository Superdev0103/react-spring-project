# Preface

When Spring came to the 5.x era, I followed the official development progress in that period and tasted the new features as early as possible. Then I wrote down a long article - [Reactive Programming with Spring 5](https://hantsy.medium.com/reactive-programming-with-spring-5-3bfc5d324ba0) to introduce the new Reactive feature brought by Spring 5. Aside from this article, I have created a collection of small projects to demonstrate the example usage mentioned in the article. The example codes can be fetched from [hantsy/spring-reactive-sample](https://github.com/hantsy/spring-reactive-sample).

As time goes by, some content is out of date, and the example codes also should be refreshed according to the changes introduced in the latest Spring and Spring Boot. So I decided to restructure the article into a mini book form and update the example codes simultaneously.

## Audience

It is a book to introduce the newest Spring WebFlux stack.

It is not a comprehensive reference book to explore Spring Framework. If you are new to Spring, I suggest you read [Spring in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-in-action-sixth-edition) from Manning or [Pro Spring](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781430261520) from Apress.

I assume that you have some experience in Spring application development and know well about Java 8/11 syntax.

## Example Codes

When introducing new things to the newbie, I believe that *an example exceeds a thousand words*.  For all *Reactive* features in Spring and its ecosystem, including Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Session, etc.,  I try to explore them with simple working examples.

All example codes used in this book are available in [hantsy/spring-reactive-sample](https://github.com/hantsy/spring-reactive-sample).

In the README of the above repository, I created two tables to list all examples clearly with a simple description, pick up any of them and play them on your local system.

## Contribution

Any form of contribution is welcome.

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/hantsy/spring-reactive-sample/issues) if there is an error found in the sample codes or the content of the book itself, or describe something that is missing in the book.

If my writing is helpful for you, help me to spread it out to your circles or [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hantsy).:)
