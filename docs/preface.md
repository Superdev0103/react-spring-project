# Preface

When Spring came to the 5.x era, I have kept update with the development progress in that period,  and wrote down a long article - [Reactive Programming with Spring 5](https://hantsy.medium.com/reactive-programming-with-spring-5-3bfc5d324ba0) to introduce  the new Reactive feature brought by Spring 5.  Aside from this article, I have created a collection of small projects to demonstrate the example usage mentioned in the article, these codes can be fetched from [hantsy/spring-reactive-sample](https://github.com/hantsy/spring-reactive-sample).

As time goes by, some content of the article should update to date and the example codes also should be refreshed according to the changes introduced in the latest Spring and Spring Boot. So I decide to restructure the article into a mini book form and also try to update the example codes simultaneously.

## Audience

This book is introduction-level resource for the newest Spring WebFlux stack.  I assume you have some experience of Spring application development and also know well about Java 8+ syntax. 

When introducing a new technology to the newbie, I believe that an example exceeds a thousand of words.  So every *Reactive* points in Spring and its ecosystem, such as Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Session, etc. I try to explore them with simple working examples.

 ## Example Codes

You can get all the example codes of this book  from  [hantsy/spring-reactive-sample](https://github.com/hantsy/spring-reactive-sample).

In the readme of the above repository,  I created two table to list all examples with a simple text-based introduction, you can pick up any of them and play it on your local system.

## Contribution

Any form of contribution is welcome, please [file an issue](https://github.com/hantsy/spring-reactive-sample/issues)  if you find there are some errors in the sample codes or the content of the book , or describe something is missing in the book.

If you found my writing is helpful for you, do not hesitate to spread out to your circles.
